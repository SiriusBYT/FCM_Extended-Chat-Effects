### This module hooks into the "FC-ChatEffects_Animated" and "FC-ChatEffects_Text" FlashCore Modules.

Since Flashcord Beta, several Flashcord Effects got removed due to either poor client performance or due to them being entirely useless.

This official Flashcord Module will let you have them back.

#### Re-Added Chat Effects:

- Rainbow Text
- Green Background
- Red Background
- Blue Background
- Loud Effect
- Quiet Effect
- Spinning Effect
- Rainbow Shadow
- Splash Text Effect
